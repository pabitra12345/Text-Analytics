If you are a poor boy you can't go there. They have scollership but this is too low.It's placement ratio also bad. They show you rong information about placement.Extra activities are available in good condition like sports and gym extra.Academic condition is ok but not well.

If I talk about faculties in amity then I just want to say that my high school teachers were good than amity's faculties and this is the reality that amity spends 60% money on advertisement, no money for labs, try to find cheap faculties(they don't know anything about teaching that's why they are cheap) and no money for student's facilities. so, I recommend you that if you are going to take admission in amity then please invest your money somewhere else even you are getting only 0.2% benefit because once you take admission then you start wasting your money.\n",

      "Hello guys. I was a student for Amity university for a long time. I Did my graduation & Masters from the same college whereas I loved being here.When we talk about academic programs in Amity you will get it all. See while I was studying in my graduation in Amity I was given the exposure of French, Behavioral science & communication skills which is very important to face the outside world whereas when we talk about the normal subject They were a complete mixture of everything and the most important to boost your confidence in Amity is to give presentation in front of the whole class and from that you will know that you are ready for the outside world or not. See the thing that is most important is a confidence which is boosted over here and that is what is expected from these kind of universities.When we talk about administration they have worked hard to maintain it but there are still a lot of flows in the administration of Amity university when we talk about the security refund part no information are given to student from where you can get it. Whereas for anything clearance you need to get approval from 10 places which is not that good. So I think if they can improve there administration it will be best for them.Ya the extracurricular is the most famous thing in Amity university they have for extracurricular Sagathan & AYF i.e. Amity youth fest. Then  for the students to have a relaxed time several stars also come and visit amity and this is also a fun time for all the students. Whereas, They have Foreign laguages in each semester and the most important Thing the 1 week Military training camp.Alumni network is also nice I graduated from 2014 batch and for the alumni meet I was called on 2017 so in after three years they arrange it and this shows that the alumni network is great and plus you get a placement mentor too which are your seniors who just cleared last year so they can help you out in getting a job and the placements are also good.All in all I had an amazing experience in Amity University. I studied graduation & then Post graduation from it. I leared a lot of things and got the placement in a prestigious company in Advertising field and I loved my job and all in all everything was amazing in Amity university it completely changes you.\n",

Because of their irresponse I have faced a lot of problems in my results. For that I had to spent a lot of extra money for their faults -course extension, assignments submission link. By then I just got fed up with Amity. I think it was a great mistake to take admission in Amity. Now in June 2017, I wrote my semester -3 MBA term exams. I am unable to view my results. When I complainted they said, they will update with semester-4 results. I just need to know my results right now.And moreover synopsis link is not activated until last submission date, they told  me to take course extension, why should I pay extra money for your faults, it is such a ridicoluos behaviour.For Dec-17 exams, there are only two centres in Delhi/NCR, both are full.
