Mouthshut,Amity University,2,"[' Mar 21, 2018 ']","I have recently completed my 4 years course from amity university. What I have observed is that I had been paying 2 lakhs per year to amity for nothing. If I talk about faculties in amity then I just want to say that my high school teachers were good than amity's faculties and this is the reality that amity spends 60% money on advertisement, no money for labs, try to find cheap faculties(they don't know anything about teaching that's why they are cheap) and no money for student's facilities. so, I recommend you that if you are going to take admission in amity then please invest your money somewhere else even you are getting only 0.2% benefit because once you take admission then you start wasting your money."

Mouthshut,Amity University,5,"[' Mar 13, 2018 ']","Hello guys. I was a student for Amity university for a long time. I Did my graduation & Masters from the same college whereas I loved being here.When we talk about academic programs in Amity you will get it all. See while I was studying in my graduation in Amity I was given the exposure of French, Behavioral science & communication skills which is very important to face the outside world whereas when we talk about the normal subject They were a complete mixture of everything and the most important to boost your confidence in Amity is to give presentation in front of the whole class and from that you will know that you are ready for the outside world or not. See the thing that is most important is a confidence which is boosted over here and that is what is expected from these kind of universities.When we talk about administration they have worked hard to maintain it but there are still a lot of flows in the administration of Amity university when we talk about the security refund part no information are given to student from where you can get it. Whereas for anything clearance you need to get approval from 10 places which is not that good. So I think if they can improve there administration it will be best for them.Ya the extracurricular is the most famous thing in Amity university they have for extracurricular Sagathan & AYF i.e. Amity youth fest. Then  for the students to have a relaxed time several stars also come and visit amity and this is also a fun time for all the students. Whereas, They have Foreign laguages in each semester and the most important Thing the 1 week Military training camp.Alumni network is also nice I graduated from 2014 batch and for the alumni meet I was called on 2017 so in after three years they arrange it and this shows that the alumni network is great and plus you get a placement mentor too which are your seniors who just cleared last year so they can help you out in getting a job and the placements are also good.All in all I had an amazing experience in Amity University. I studied graduation & then Post graduation from it. I leared a lot of things and got the placement in a prestigious company in Advertising field and I loved my job and all in all everything was amazing in Amity university it completely changes you."

With lot of exploring options it goes on to provide all academic programs and with lot of extracurricular activities but all coming at a cost to really think of and the training and other foreign trips for study and programs are alone costing about 8 lakhs at the 3rd year of the engineering. With the administration being too secretive about all the things from taking money for the management quota and all the other financial matters but though being trying to be innovative and exploring they are of course commercial minded. With no notable to look out for at one go alumni and an really expensive course it's really stands as a burden to the middle class students and their families and therefore not to go on account of value for money as after spending a hefty amount of 16-20 lakhs it's not worthy to get a job placement average with 3-4 lakhs ranging generally.But again to say with all these if you have money to really not count on and is ready to invest on knowing the returns than you can surely go for it.

Mouthshut,Amity University,1,"[' May 01, 2017 ']","I had been the part of Amity university weekend program(M.Tech. CSE Wknd) 2015-2017 and found this program a complete failure. Being a working professional, you want to get really up to date curriculum for all the subjects covered. However, this wasn't the case there.In case you are not in town due to some official visit and your exams fall in that duration, university should be flexible enough to shift the exam dates in such cases especially for working professionals. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case there.For all small things that can be done online, you are required to visit the university premises e.g. for fee submission, you has to be there in university.Below are few highlights that warn you before taking admission into Amity University's weekend programs-obsolete course content. However, they claim it's updated as they still live in 20's:)lack of quality teaching. Faculties are not up to date as per the current market trends.no flexible exam timings for working professionals. If you cannot attend the exam, you'll get failed.75% attendance is must to appear in the exam for working professionals also. If you cannot attend the class due to some official reasons, it won't be considered.for all trivial things, you need to visit university premises during weekdays. Obviously, you need to take leave from office for the same. University staff is not ready to understand that as all the staff is available on weekdays only.Most of the administrative staff is from Ex. Army professionals. They don't understand the difference between ""Full Time"" and ""Part Time"" programs and want ""Part Time"" students to be available any time they want.Even if you've enrolled for weekend programs, you are required to read ""news boards"" regularly. e.g. Last date of fee submission was changed and notice was put down on notice board. All weekend students could not read this info as they don't get time to read the notice board regularly. Late fee submission penalty was applied for such students. Again, typical Army personnel's monopoly."

Mouthshut,Amity University,2,"[' Mar 16, 2017 ']","I am writing this review because I had been in Amity university Gurgaon campus a dozen times.It is a wide spreaded campus with large no. of buildings and hostels. If you start visiting all of the campus it will take a good amount of time to complete, my younger brother was enrolled in this campus for persuading B.Tech with computer science engineering.We took his admission here because he didn't scored a much better rank in AIEEE exam and fortunately or unfortunately he got selected in counseling based on CBSE central counseling system. The course was good and the fee structure was too good which could not be comfortable paid by any middle class family, we managed to get education loan and paid off the fees in regular semester intervals.Year by year the institution increased their fee of tuition as well as hostel which also on gradual rates. Till final semester my brothers fee was became around 20 thousand extra what we paid off in first semester, really strange, We can't ignore the face that every middle class family wants their kid to study in big campuses from where he could get a successful career beginning. Eventually the course structure or the exam system was not that good students were unable to co-up with the technical capabilities. It result with none of my brothers friend(even my brother) got selected for any good company campus drive.Many guys started working in smaller companies paying approx 10K monthly, I was amazed to see them paid off 7 lakh for B.Tech and now earning 10K monthly. After four years of not working hard my brother somehow cracked GATE exam and now persuading his M.Tech from IIIT Allahabad with cyber law and information security branch.I really suggest the parents and the youth who are about to get enrolled for Amity or similar highly charged universities, don't join blindly in false hope that you will be get good job.

Mouthshut,Amity University,5,"[' Feb 06, 2017 ']","This review is specifically focussed on Amity University, Noida campus, sec-125. No way the university has gained an enormous success during the recent years. You might have seen several advertisement on TV.No doubt, the university has an excellent infrastructure and facilities inside the campus. it has always been a hub of rich people you might see a lot of luxurious cars outside as well as inside when you visit the campus. But most of the people there belongs to average income family.If you are going to the campus for the 1st time for admissions or enquiries, go to gate no 3 or 4.Education: Tough one. If you gets an admission in any of the courses in amity campus, forget about the life. You are just an amitian and that's it until you leave that campus. You will be proud to be an amitian, but you might lose most of your friend circle outside the campus. They will always keep you busy with the activities all the time. Don't forget 75% attendance is necessary or else they will through you out(Worst thin actually and you will suffer for sure). And yes, you have to attend the Boring continuous lecture of 3 hours. Yes you read it right, continuous 3 hours, sometimes more. They do have a great library which have lost of computers to work on or just to pass the time when you are bunking the lecture;). In Fact, they have CCD there too.Food: Dominos, Dhosa plaza, CCD, Grocery Store, Subway, Chinese food, Cafe's. You wont be able to finish everything in your time span of amity life. But, I would suggest you to look first onto the Dhabas and small shops that are outside the campus. Honestly, they are 100 times better than the food that is being served inside the campus(Lunch meal in F block). Moreover, they are cheap and tasty too.Security: Excellent. No doubt been there for 3 years, I have not heard a single case of eve-teasing. Ragging is not allowed inside the campus. There are security guards with dogs  roaming around inside the campus. In short, girls are safe. Marshalls are there everywhere. One have many things to do without getting concerned. You might find some good friends for life or even love:D.Sports: Excellent. They do have a good ground to be played several sports on. Being cricket or volleyball. they do have the good stuff. They have one event year named ""SANGATHAN"", try to see what it is. But let me tell you they wont cut your attendance if you dont attend the event.Language courses: On the website they have shows that they have several languages there. But honestly, you will find 99% people with german or french. Sometimes, chinese but that's I guess a few students. When you will be passing out, dont worry you will forget everything so do not focus much. But the certificate you will be getting from there will surely hep you a lot in building your career.Administration: Well, stay away from them. Most of them are pissed of due to high work load all the time. So, dont panic just relax if suffer from anything, they are good.Hostel: I was not a hostler, but I have visited few times. The security is good there. Rooms are ok, but they are pretty costly. I would highly recommend to search nearby ex- Sec-18 or nearby Expressway. At lease you will have full freedom to come and go. At amity, I guess you are not allowed to enter into the campus after 10 or 11 pm. Thats sucks most of the time.Annual fest: They have food, they have people. The thing they dont have is good performers. Free for amitians but costly for others. Believe me, dont pay for that fest. If you can arrange passes that's good. It runs for 3 consecutive days.In the end, Amity is one of the good university in India to give your career a boost. They do have a distance programme, so you can join it if you are not able to come. Convocation is really good and you should attend it.You will get to develop your overall personality for sure if you work hard. Don't forget your ID card. You will need it to enter into the campus.Be ready for some surprises as well.  You might get to see your favorites actors/actresses there;).All the best!"

Mouthshut,Amity University,2,"[' Oct 11, 2016 ']",The amity university is the most popular university in the north side of india. The large no. of studengs ard going and studing that way ghis colleges and university has its own hype. I think that the university is only ment for the sgudents who has lots of money to just invest in the perticular place so this is not so good because the value of can not understood by students it can only understood by parents who is taking careof their students. So the situations are very much different then other.
Mouthshut,Amity University,1,"[' Oct 09, 2016 ']","I have completed my Btech from amity university in mechanical engineering and passed out in the year 2015.This college is mostly suitable for the rich brads who owns their daddy ka paisa.Initially when I took admission in this college lot of fake promises were made about the placements and packages. But after being exposed to reality only 30% students are placed in companies like tier 2, tier 3we need to pay ton of rupees to seek admission in these universities which we have flind faith due to their big branding. but reality seems much farer than it.I would suggest if you guys only degree and later wanna shift to family business its the best college to spend ur time, But if you people wanna get good knowledge and education for your career growth then I would only suggest one thing ""THINK WISELY"".Dont waste your die hard income in these colleges which are worthless."
Mouthshut,Amity University,1,"[' Oct 07, 2016 ']","Amity university is one of the private university of India. In this university also take several courses to take admission like graduation, post-graduation and management courses and so on. In this university only rich students can take admission because in this university they charged so highly fees to their student that who one can rich then go their children to study in amity university. Otherwise in the middle class family or low middle class family not bear this fees to their children to take admission in this type of university to studies. If they want but not send to their children for charging so much fees. In case if In a normal delhi university or other govt. colleges the fees for whole graduation or masters cost one to just 10, 000-15, 000 of B.A  and B.COM students fees and in B.SC courses upto 25, 000 But in this university, they have a limited seats so everyone not gets admission in government colleges or universities, So students want to continue their study then they move to private colleges or universities to take admission but in they can think to take admission if  from Amity like university it will cost you in lakhs for a normal b.com degree. So you think management and specialization courses from private university then they will charge upto 7-8 lakhs. so generally middle class and low middle class not afford to sent their children to study in private colleges. So if the students can not take admission in government college and their family condition is not so good then their last option to leave studies and move to job without grooming their talent and that case the future of these student have no career. So I have to suggested that in that private university will down their fees are little low and take admission to those who can not bear their fees and gave a chance to talented students to achieve in their career and create a name in this field and make proud to also their university that this student will pass on from this university, this will be best university and several students wants to take admission to see the results of these university by every year student was pass with good marks and attain a good job in market and the university provide some exemption in fees for special students. So this will make a good rapport in the market of private university like AMITY University and so on other university."

Mouthshut,Amity University,4,"[' Sep 11, 2016 ']","Hey guys I will told you about Computer science at amity university is more focused on the theoretical part however you will have plenty of opportunity to go ahead and implement your learnings. Most colleges do not focus much on practical knowledge but again this is in no way stopping you from going ahead and practicing on your own(no spoon feeding). Learn a new language of your interest once you grasp the basics.After this lets come to the internship part, they are decent enough. I did my internship in AT&T which is a pretty good organization to go ahead and work for even for a short duration. Most students get internships on their own so you can go for Amazon however it does not come for internship recruitment.Placements are good in comparison to a lot of private and other colleges. In my batch the maximum package went for 8.5 LPA but again if you perform well in your internship that same company might offer you a package much more(13LPA+ in a friends case), so it all comes down to what you did different in those 4 years of your college which later makes it much simple to get into a company you want while others are struggling with testing and support jobs.Work hard, learn something new, become an expert(its not at all difficult you've got 4 years) you'll find much much better companies than you can imagine."

In a normal delhi university or other govt. colleges the fees for whole graduation or masters cost one to just 15-20, 000 or upto 50, 000 for science courses I think so. And where if you are doing from Amity it will cost you in lakhs for a normal b.com degree. It is a common saying for amity students that ghar baithne se acha h college m enjoy krke degree lelo and paisa bahut h . Generally amity students are going to college in their big big cars like audi ; bmw ; porsche ; hyundai ; toyoto etc . So it is not bad to say Amity university for the rich."

Mouthshut,Amity University,2,"[' Aug 27, 2016 ']","As per my opinion Amity University is one of the fastest growing indian university but not due to its high reputation in education and placement, it is due to its very good level of advertisement in a wrong way. If you are looking for a university having good infrastructure and facility then Amity is good. But, with education and job point of view it is worst. Placement record of this university is very bad. It is producing a number of unemployed graduates every year. The level of education is not upto the mark. Total wastage of money."

I think twice about it so much and I get envious when I see other understudies making the most of their school life. It is one of the most noticeably awful choices I have made.At the start they depict Amity to be a world class college, yet in the meantime, they carry on as though they are from a very backward tribe with a lot of senseless rules.The hostel superintendents and inn executive are so impolite towards students. They frequently depend on beating and slapping students. There have been numerous instances of students attempting suicide under these weights yet this is basically quieted far from anyone's regular field of vision.

In amity its necessary to choose one Foreign Language which definitely provide you a star in you curriculum vitae.this university is quite expensive but it provide you some major benefits of many different things like they provide you diploma in communication skills, diploma in Behavioral science and so on.

First of all it is a private university and this thing should always be kept in mind that the GOVT. universities are much better than the private ones. Also, the degree pursued through a GOVT. Unviersity would be more valuable as compared to the private ones. Amity university has a very good infrastructure and indeed the campus is really huge. However, the fees is so high that every one can't afford to seek admission in it. Moreover the placement efficiency is very low considering the high amount of fees.

They help in understanding each subject carefully. They help in developing presentation skills, and sometimes they give good reference to get internships.I had my internship in Sahara India Pariwar, Corporate Communication Department as a Market Researcher. They paid 7.5K at the end of eight weeks internship with certification.I passed out in 2009-10 and it was the time when in the private sector was suffering from financial recession crisis moment which was affected campus placement. But in that time Amity did a wonderful job, they brought 4 industrial giants like Accenture, Wipro, Times Now, Hindustan Times for the placement.In every winter season, a cultural festival organised in Amity Lucknow Malhore Campus by the management. The festival name is SAMANVAY meaning ""Something which is equally applicable to all.""This stage gave endless opportunity to showcase cultural activity to all students.In my course, there were no labs. I had weekly presentations at the stage in our classroom. Our exam system was semester based. Papers were split into two parts. Internal assessment and external assessment. Each paper 60 marks for external and 40 for internal, both papers to clear to clear a subject and get the score.Fee structure in Amity is expensive than government MBA colleges. In my course, I had four semesters and each semester costs 96K. Apart from that, there were other fees like the security deposit and hostel fees.Hostel facility was very good. They provided me a shared room with a partner. Each room member gets a table, chair, cupboard, bed, and mattress. 24/7 room cleaning service, purified water, generator back up and separate toilet for every six students.Mess food was good and hygienic. Pure 100% veg meals every day. Mess fees are not included in hostel fee. So you need to pay every month to get the mess food.I did not have any scholarship availed from Amity University. I am not sure about it.Education loan facility offered by most of the banks. I had loans from PNB.Friendship starts at Amity. Fun moments in hostel parties every weekend. There were the gym, table tennis, volleyball, cricket tournaments, dance, debate and singing competition too.I never got any reference from my alumni network and senior students of Amity. But interaction opportunities are there and many time they helped junior students in getting placed or searching internship.Amity Lucknow Campus was in construction at the time when I was there.

Amity is a business with its main agenda being  misguiding the students that are in a point in life where they feel lost.BOTTOM LINE - there are mainly 2 reasons why someone decides to join a college - Education or college life, amity wont provide you with either.>Education - as bad as it can get, horrible faculty, in no way whatsoever even worth 10% of the total fees, if you intend to study to make urself capable then my friend dont even read rest of the review just forget that Amity even exists>College life - once you join amity you wont even have ur own normal life leave alone college life, classes get over at 5 in the evening, 75% attendance and NO MEDICAL ACCEPTED(no matter how genuine) so bunking is a luxury, quality of students debatable since literally no whatsoever admission criteriaI would only suggest this college if you fulfill all the following criteria-1)ur motive is to pass time for few years since ur bored sitting at home,2)you dont need a degree or education since you already have to join family business,3)most importantly if you have around 10lakh rs to wasteA little in depth to why Amity is probably the worst decision you will make in ur life:->Completely unreasonable fees - The quality of education they provide is a joke when you take into account the price tag on each of the courses. For 10% of Amity's fees you can get a much more reputable degree, 10 times better education.The only thing that you will get from that huge fees is their infrastructure, I am not sure what one is supposed to do with that but to each their own->Faculty is a joke - I cannot say this about all courses but everyday in classes I used to think that this must be some kind of elaborate joke, anytime now someone will kick open the door of the class and tell us that infact they are the real teacher and the guy is pretending to be our teacher and this was just a practical joke, and I kept waiting but that day never came.I will give the teachers the benefit of doubt and say that they might have the knowledge but majority of them are truly miserable when it comes to their teaching skills. Out of 15 faculty members I had the opportunity of learning from literally only 1 could be considered as a real teacher, with that probability I wouldnt be so sure about the faculty of other courses as well->Student welfare will never ever be in their priority list - The day you submit your fees is the last day they would care about you, you officially are all on ur own now.No medical certificates allowed - God forbid you face an emergency and that causes you to miss out on ur education, Amity will provide you no assistance at all no matter if u are hospitalized or ur loved ones are on their deathbeds.You will be marked absent, they will refuse help. I must provide 1 example from my experience. I was severely ill and was hospitalized for a little less than a month, I went to the dy director of their Institute and explained to him what I was going through, showed him not only my medical certificates but literally also the medical bills for the month.His reply to me after listening to the troubles I went through was ""we are not legally liable to anything, if you want to continue with us then u should submit fees for the next semester"". Till this date I have yet to meet someone as pathetic and disgusting as MR. VIKAS MADHUKAR, he is literally sitting in an educational institute not giving a flying f u c k about students or their problems(just like the college)->75% attendance or fail - Generally almost all colleges have attendance rules and there is nothing wrong about it since they implement such rule to make sure students attend classes. The rule is same here but the motive of having such rule isnt. It is just a convenient way for them to ask you for more money and more importantly so that after you face so much delay(can only give re-examinations after 1 sem, i.e. if you fail to keep 75% attendance in 2nd sem you can only appear for exams in 4th sem) and troubles completing ur course that you will have to come back to amity for further studies too->Admission Tests are a formality - I feel the entrance tests can tell you a lot about the standard of the institute - what they stand for and what they wish to be in the future. This just further proves the fact that they are indeed a business. Like any other business they wish to maximize their profits which in this case would be to accept everything and anything.Earlier I didnt mind this since I wasnt to really worried about the quality of students, but the problem is that the crowd of the college is the last thing that concerns me about accepting everyone. When an institute has no criteria whatsoever that just showcases their true colors. In this case being duping & fooling as many students as quickly as possible."

The Faculty have no say in anything, no autonomy, no respect. Everything is dictated by the AVP and the Senior Director.The organization only labels itself a university. It actually runs worse than a small corporate office. The major reason is that some people in the Management have been planted from Noida - who are incapable of fulfilling their duties.Faculty are dictated(often shouted at) by a few people(who don't know how to behave and respect others like human beings) from the management(like the AVP and the Senior Director), who think that they are the kings/queens of this place and demand to be treated like royalty.Faculty are imprisoned for 8.5 hours. They are frowned upon whenever they request for leaves. They are not given any time for academic work. Only running after students and similar clerical work(the Amizone software and countless Excel Sheets) - that too work that is often repeated - for lack of organization/communication among the management.No Faculty here would feel that there is an academic spirit in this organization. They only focus on bringing corporate people and organizing Bollywood-based events. It is almost impossible to convince the(illiterate and uncultured) Management to organize academic seminars/conferences/bringing stalwarts from academia - especially in the Arts.

Mouthshut,Amity University,4,"[' Feb 22, 2017 ']","I am student of amity university and before I go to that university I have research all information about amity.so I would like to share with you.The German Embassy has requested the Indian government for  extradition, but the Chauhans have successfully evaded  arrest/extradition for close to a decade. Ashok first went to Germany as  a student, from western UP, and stayed on to trade in chemicals.Ashok  and Arun duped banking institutions not only in Germany,  but elsewhere too. The Delhi High Court, on a petition filed by US-based  Formossa Plastics Corporation, had restrained them from disposing of or  otherwise encumbering properties standing/acquired in the names of the  Ritnanad Balved Education Foundation(Ashok is the founder president of  the foundation which runs Amity institutions), Ritnanad Balved Medical  Foundation, Europa Foundation and his Trust Foundation. Formossa  requested the judiciary for registration of an fir against Ashok and  others for cheating them. The Chauhans purchased plastic material from  the company, but did not bother to clear the bills. Their total  liability: Rs 95 crore. Based on the US company’s petition, the other  properties on which the restraint order was issued were: 15 acres in  Sector 44, Noida(Amity School complex); B-166, Sector 36; 113 acres at  Panchgaon Manesar; and 5 acres in Saket.On another petition filed by  kreiss Bank, Germany, the Delhi High Court attached bank accounts worth  Rs 15 crore of Ashok and his family. A Netherlands-based company, kivo,  also filed a suit against the Chauhans for recovery of approximately Rs  10 crore, the bill for purchase of materials from the company. Ashok and  Arun, now residing at E-27, Defence Colony, New Delhi, are accused of  intending to get hold of unlawful property and of having caused property  damages to others by concealing facts.According to the arrest warrant  issued against them by the German judicial authorities, the brothers  fooled credit institutions and banks. They claimed that their firms,  kunstoplast and kunstochem, in Germany, were solvent enterprises and  between November 1993 and March 1994, Ashok obtained discounted loans on  bills of exchange from various financial institutions. They pretended  that the credit slips were good bills of exchange. But the bills of  exchange were not paid on due date because the drawees were insolvent.  The warrant states that the accused were able to withdraw in time —  after spending nearly two decades in the country — to escape German  prosecution. They camouflaged their flights abroad as business trips,  and never returned. Ashok left Germany after March 26, 1994 on the  pretext of negotiating with sponsors to save his akc group in Germany.  On reaching Delhi, he filed a petition for bankruptcy(from June to  November 1994). Alexander Frey, head, legal department, Kreiss Bank  Frankfurt, told Tehelka, “Ashok and Arun have damaged kreiss Bank by$6  million(Rs 24 crore approx) and some more banks have lost between$15-20 million(Rs 60-80 crore approx).” Public Prosecutor Dominique  Crede also confirmed this in an e-mail. Frey in an e-mail said the  district attorney in Frankfurt had been trying to get the Chauhans  extradited to Germany since 1996.The German Embassy spokesman in New  Delhi, Michael Reiffuenstuel, said, “The arrest warrants against Ashok  and Arun are open and valid. There is a Red Corner Notice against them  for frauds committed in Germany. In 2003, the embassy wrote to the  ministry of external affairs. Oral requests were also made for their  extradition, but there has been no response.”Further, Minister of State  for External Affairs E. Ahmed, in a written reply dated May 12, to an  unstarred question asked by Rajya Sabha mp RK Anand, confirmed: “…valid  warrants of arrest issued by German judicial authorities against Shri  Ashok Kumar Chauhan and Arun Kumar Chauhan, directors of Amity  International, Ghaziabad, UP, exist and the Interpol has issued Red  Corner Notices Nos. 453/1990 and 459/1998 at the request of Interpol  Wiesbaden… The Embassy of Federal Republic of Germany in India has  requested for legal assistance in serving documents/extradition of Ashok  Kumar Chauhan and Arun Kumar Chauhan.”The arrest warrant, an English  translation of which was procured by Tehelka, lists six cases against  the Chauhans. In the first case, the accused submitted to the kreiss  Bank one bill of exchange of over dm 496, 628.00 for discounting and for  crediting the discount proceeds to kunstoplast’s account with the bank.  The total damage to the bank was dm 487, 832.58(Rs 5, 90, 28, 398). This  bill was issued on November 18, 1993, and was due on March 5, 1994. The  firm, kivo, in Volendam, was the issuer and kunstoplast was the drawee.  The acceptance of the drawee as well as the endorsement for kreiss Bank  were signed by Ashok. The bill was protested on March 8, 1994, due to  lack of payment.Another case was to the disadvantage of Savings Bank  Naila, wherein by mutual agreement with the conspirators, the accused,  Arun, requested that the bank discount a bill of exchange of over dm  448, 200.00 and credit the discount proceeds to the account of  kunstochem. The bill was protested on March 11, 1994 for lack of  payment. The total damage to the bank dm 438, 980.53(Rs 5, 31, 16, 580).In  the third case, kreiss Bank was commissioned by the accused to discount a  bill of over dm 532, 125.00 on behalf of the firm, kunstoplast. This  bill was issued on November 22, 1993 and was due on March 16, 1994. Due  to lack of payment the bank protested the bill on March 18, 1994. The  total damage was dm 523, 477.97(Rs 6, 33, 40, 717). The fourth case relates  to disadvantage of Savings Bank Naila and the damage was dm 533, 042.81.  The acceptance of the drawee as well as the mentioned endorsements were  signed by Ashok. The bill was protested due to lack of payment. The  warrant states that the accused, Arun, disposed of the credit balance to  transfer dm 544, 000.00. The total damage was dm 533, 042.81(Rs  6, 44, 98, 082).The fifth case was to the disadvantage of kreiss Bank and  the damage was dm 568.619, 40. The bank protested this bill on March 28,  1994, due to lack of payment. On December 27, 1993, the discount  proceeds of dm 568, 619.40 were deposited in the account and were used to  credit the overdraft limit of dm 1 million, which was again by  disposals in January and February 1994, fully exhausted. The total  damage was dm 568, 619.40(Rs 6, 88, 02, 899). The last case also pertained  to disadvantages to kreiss Bank and the damage was dm 543, 881.00. On  March 10, 1994, the accused submitted to kreiss Bank a bill of exchange  of over dm 556, 400.00 with the request for discount to credit the  proceeds to kunstoplast. The total damage was dm 543, 881.00(Rs  6, 58, 09, 601).So guys thats it I think I will help you."

Mouthshut,Amity University,3,"[' Sep 09, 2016 ']","Amity is a brand, as said but a brand which needs to prove itself in some aspects. Amity is one of the best universities in India but with some changes can become even better and be at the top. Amity offers you its services for B.Com(H), BBA(H), BA. Economics, MBA, B.Arch, Bachelor/Master in Journalism and Mass Communication, B.Tech, Bachelor in Interior Designing, BA LLB, BBA LLB, B.Sc. in Biotechnology. Some of these courses are not available at other colleges. I'm a student of Amity and I must say that one of the things which needs to be changed asap is the rule of decision making which usually happens in Noida campus as for everything the Noida campus is in charge, don't you think this is wrong? I mean for smallest of things the permission should be taken from Noida, just because it's the main campus. Apart from this the other aspects have been quite good such as the academics and the co-curricular activities but at the end of the day the students are tired and that is because of the timings of the university which is not at all worth for the age of college students, spending 10 hours of your day in the college isn't really required because students need to do a lot much things and because of our college we are not able to do anything else apart from our academics not even sports(which is not even provided in the college), that's too much the students are doing for their graduation. The faculties are also good except some but that's alright with the students as you cannot get the best teachers every time. Also one of the rules which should be changed or atleast should be dealt with some leniency with respect to some serious times when students cannot maintain 75% attendance, the students understand the rule but sometimes due to some reasons students are not able to keep their attendance, I'm not saying that every student should be allowed to appear in the exam but my suggestion to solve this problem is that a committee should be made which will decide whether the student should be allowed to sit in the exam or not, the student with his parents should be given a chance to explain the reason for which the student was not able to maintain his attendance. One of the positive things about being in Amity is that you always get the chance to learn and grow with various seminars, assignments, group discussions, panel discussion, etc. With workshops and guest lectures Amity always gives you a chance to learn from people who are ready to share their knowledge and experience with you. This isn't the end as with your respective UG programmes you will also get the opportunity to choose a minor track where you will study a different course for 3 hours with one subject in each semester and after that you get the opportunity to learn a foreign language which i'm sure very less universities can offer. In the end I would like to conclude by saying that Amity offers you a different environment as compared to other universities and for a hard working student it is a good place to learn."

Mouthshut,Amity University,1,"[' Jun 05, 2016 ']","If you feel like wasting ur parents money then instead of joining Amity, I would highly recommend you take all the money and light it on fire.The fire will keep you warm for a while, that is much more useful than Amity will ever be to you.If you want to save time by not reading the entire review then just trust me when I say this RUN from amity.Run as far as you can, as fast as you can & thank me later.First and foremost please dont consider Amity as an institution that aims to provide you with education, that is the last thing Amity is. Amity is a business with its main agenda being misguiding the students that are in a point in life where they feel lost.BOTTOM LINE - there are mainly 2 reasons why someone decides to join a college - Education or college life, amity wont provide you with either.>Education - as bad as it can get, horrible faculty, in no way whatsoever even worth 10% of the total fees, if you intend to study to make urself capable then my friend dont even read rest of the review just forget that Amity even exists>College life - once you join amity you wont even have ur own normal life leave alone college life, classes get over at 5 in the evening, 75% attendance and NO MEDICAL ACCEPTED(no matter how genuine) so bunking is a luxury, quality of students debatable since literally no whatsoever admission criteriaI would only suggest this college if you fulfill ALL the following criteria-1)ur motive is to pass time for few years since ur bored sitting at home,2)you dont need a degree or education since you already have to join family business,3)most importantly if you have around 10lakh rs to wasteA little in depth to why Amity is probably the worst decision you will make in ur life:->Completely unreasonable fees - The quality of education they provide is a joke when you take into account the price tag on each of the courses. For 10% of Amity's fees you can get a much more reputable degree, 10 times better education.The only thing that you will get from that huge fees is their infrastructure, I am not sure what one is supposed to do with that but to each their own->Faculty is a joke - I cannot say this about all courses but everyday in classes I used to think that this must be some kind of elaborate joke, anytime now someone will kick open the door of the class and tell us that infact they are the real teacher and the guy is pretending to be our teacher and this was just a practical joke, and I kept waiting but that day never came.I will give the teachers the benefit of doubt and say that they might have the knowledge but majority of them are truly miserable when it comes to their teaching skills. Out of 15 faculty members I had the opportunity of learning from literally only 1 could be considered as a real teacher, with that probability I wouldnt be so sure about the faculty of other courses as well->Student welfare will never ever be in their priority list - The day you submit your fees is the last day they would care about you, you officially are all on ur own now.->No medical certificates allowed - God forbid you face an emergency and that causes you to miss out on ur education, Amity will provide you no assistance at all no matter if u are hospitalized or ur loved ones are on their deathbeds.You will be marked absent, they will refuse help. I must provide 1 example from my experience. I was severely ill and was hospitalized for a little less than a month, I went to the dy director of their Institute and explained to him what I was going through, showed him not only my medical certificates but literally also the medical bills for the month.His reply to me after listening to the troubles I went through was ""we are not legally liable to anything, if you want to continue with us then u should submit fees for the next semester"". Till this date I have yet to meet someone as pathetic and disgusting as MR. VIKAS MADHUKAR, he is literally sitting in an educational institute not giving a flying f u c k about students or their problems(just like the college)->75% attendance or fail - Generally almost all colleges have attendance rules and there is nothing wrong about it since they implement such rule to make sure students attend classes. The rule is same here but the motive of having such rule isnt. It is just a convenient way for them to ask you for more money and more importantly so that after you face so much delay(can only give re-examinations after 1 sem, i.e. if you fail to keep 75% attendance in 2nd sem you can only appear for exams in 4th sem) and troubles completing ur course that you will have to come back to amity for further studies too->Admission Tests are a formality - I feel the entrance tests can tell you a lot about the standard of the institute - what they stand for and what they wish to be in the future. This just further proves the fact that they are indeed a business. Like any other business they wish to maximize their profits which in this case would be to accept everything and anything.Earlier I didnt mind this since I wasnt to really worried about the quality of students, but the problem is that the crowd of the college is the last thing that concerns me about accepting everyone. When an institute has no criteria whatsoever that just showcases their true colors. In this case being duping & fooling as many students as quickly as possible.-| REQUEST TO ALL WHO THINK SOMEHOW AMITY IS A GOOD UNIVERSITY, HUMBLE REQUEST PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME HOW SO IN THE COMMENTS BECAUSE WHEN YOU LIE ABOUT A COLLEGE ONLINE YOU ARE LITERALLY RUINING SOMEONES MONEY, TIME, CAREER, LIFE.|-"

Lack of transport was one thing off, as I came all the way from West Delhi via metro blue line, but from Botanical Garden station, took an auto ride for 100.(return trip to Noida sec-18 station cost 80.I'm wary of sharing rides, being a female travelling alone). Entry from gate 3, had a pool of mud in front of it which people had to cross using(thoughtfully) laid out cobblestones.Admit card verfied, was given an OMR sheet and told to sit until the ""entrance exam"" started. Before that, they played a long video in the name of campus tour, as if orientation is going on and these candidates have already enrolled. Even the goddamn elevators where shown off. The test. What the hell. Just a test on middle school English grammar. Taken by all undergraduate and postgraduate applicants, regardless of what programme they're applying for. It was multiple choice, and instructions on the OMR sheet said respond using HB pencil.This created a panic among applicants because the University never notified us to bring one along. Nevertheless, the invigilator allowed use of ball point pen. It was a short, 30 min test, but ridiculous. No wonder getting accepted into Amity is easy peasy. Fortunately, my interview for the programme I applied to was third in line, and I was let off early. Didn't stay for lunch, pretty sure it was another seducing tactic for the kids to make them want to stay inside this pretty campus they only saw on screen. It's very fishy, the over-emphasis on the extravagant campus. No mention of what the studies are like. Could not find detailed syllabus of the programme I opted for on their website."

Guys I am writing this review because I want to bring the real face of Amity in front of students who are looking for admission in college. One of the Number 1 FAKE UNIVERSITY I have ever seen in my life. Amity slogan is “we nurture talent” but in reality it should be “we torture talent”. They advertise themselves by giving lots of money to Mass media, Tv channels, News papers, magazines and showing fake ranking. Taking soo much money from students and still saying NON profit university. Wow what a joke!Now I will tell you one by one the reality of departments present in amity university.1- ASET(ECE, CS, MECHANICAL, IT, EEE)- Teachers don't know anything so don't expect them that will teach you and clear your concepts. Students who are coming by reading fake promises of 100% placement. Forget about placement. If you want to waste your 8-10 Lakh rupees and your 4 years then go for it.2- Aerospace- I don't know why this department exist? Zero placement, making fool of students, no Lab for learning, no placement, no good teacher, nothing they have.3- Biotech- Same story here. Zero knowledge with zero placement.4-MBA- Guys U will get hardly 3.5 lakh package after spending your 10 lakh. Dont expect 5-8 lakh package here. Asian business school a small college which is nearby to amity giving more package then amity Mba. Amity please stop looting students.Rest all department have same story.One thing that is good about Amity university is their infrastructure only. Rest all other things are fake.SO Guys If u still want to waste your parents money and want to spoil your career then you can apply for Amity don’t worry about interview and admission test they will definitely give you admission these all are fake procedures just to show off and making fool of innocent students."
Mouthshut,Amity University,1,"[' Mar 25, 2016 ']",I am writing this just for upcoming students if they get my message ….your hard work and skills will never be cherished at amity university at all….i passed out form university and got second division degree in BTECH which I would have got first division if I was in IP colleges. My aggregate culminated to 6.3 CGPA which in IP would get around 74% and first division degree. This is a realization when you apply for master’s degree further and u need good grades.Amity is just good for its infrastructure and worse for its studies and grading system. In all my academic session I could have score 10% better marks if I was in IP University which I lost due to relative CPGA marking system. My course structure changed for around 3 times in 4 years and university is has poor management system.System is university of online student records is fake and useless. Course structures are not defined for students and it keep changing and university has cheap tricks of letting students result down to maintain standards. I got job placement in a company and got joining. But now at time of admission when I go through my marks and I calculate% it counts 74% and in CGPA it gives 6.3. Due to this marking system and grade work by amity study grades goes down and students score lesser marks. Any new 12th pass out would be searching for universities will find red building and ac rooms very fascinating and adore to live in but believe me it’s just good for ruining your career as you will not be able to score good in this university at all due to its marking system.Students in Amity remain under stress due to useless subjects being introduced and to be counted for marks in your professional results. It deteriorates the grades of students as moral value subjects and foreign language will let your result down like hell. The pattern of study in my time changed 3 times and I am recent pass out. University do not have good course structure and it’s just fluctuating aggregations just to make Amity a brand for people. Placements happen and a student gets placed but there is nothing as 100% placements so don’t be guided to a charming statement at all. At my time when I joined Amity had 5 sections of Btech CSE but now in 2016 after 5 years amity is pushing 10 sections of computer science. Just stuffing students for sake of money and killing student career.Lastly I have been guiding many student to not join amity and was guided same from amity pass out but I made a mistake. My aim to write this is just some student who reads it carefully and change mind may save their career. Amity Sucks and Ashok Chauhan is just a good decoit

Mouthshut,Amity University,3,"[' Dec 18, 2015 ']","""A few red buildings"" said one person. ""I came here because I didn't crack the entrance exams for engineering or medicine"" says another. There are many such opinions of young students(well not that young considering the fact that they have been preparing for the entrance exams for a year or more after 12th boards) who have a look on their face on the very first day of entering this university, with its crimson-colored buildings, convoluted infrastructure.etc.However, after passing out last year.i.e.2012, I have come to the conclusion that it really does not matter how many negative reviews you read or over-advertised commercials you see on television. This university has its ups and downs like every other university/college in India. It boils down to the fact that every student has to find his/her way through in college. You have to scrounge for opportunities and literally push people back in order to secure your future.My advice for freshers or 2nd year students ->1) Don't screw your academics. Trust me, it may not be an indicator of a successful person but still it matters in a cut-throat competitive environment.2) Be proactive. Participate in debates. Join a club, placement committee.etc. On  campus or off-campus.3) A few Teachers are a bit biased towards students who keep dogging them around and  end up getting more marks in the internals. Keep a lookout for them. And don't screw your internals thinking i'll make it up in the externals out of 70 marks. Also maintain your attendance at 75%. It would be a utter waste not to give the paper because you got debarred.4) Tips for students studying Biotechnology(as I was a student of the same)  -Don't think that the course becomes easy once you enter the 2nd year with Bio based subjects. It is equally hard across the semesters.5) THE MOST IMP TIP - REGARDING PLACEMENTS - Please note that the college does not guarantee 100% placements. It may sound fanciful in a brochure you picked up on your way to the campus but the real scenario is quite different. A few companies will come to campus and it is absolutely imperative that you sit for these companies and grab your offer letter ASAP. Do not worry about the salary or work they would offer you. Most of the time it  will be below your expectations. But nonetheless, you must try your luck.A final word of advice. Don't worry if you could not crack IIT-JEE, CBSE-PMT, AIEEE.etc. and ended up at Amity. The real journey has just begun. I know students who are studying at IIM-A, MIT after passing out of Amity. It is a matter of perspective. Take it as learning experience and work hard. Party harder!Valiullah HashmiB.Tech Biotechnology(Studied at B, J and I blocks)Batch of 2012Edit 1 - I have noticed that a lot of students have been sending me emails/messaging me regarding admission in this University. While I do my best to answer all of them, I may not have the time to go through each one and give a response. That being said please bear in mind that I am no admission counselor who is an expert on the subject. So kindly refrain from giving me your entrance exam data and asking which college is the best in India.etc.(some people have been doing that).I feel I have written the review to the best of my ability and mentioned points that are quite important for students who are looking to Amity for pursuing their education. However, this review is by no means meant to encompass every fibre of living in the university. Please do not take this as the final word and instead try and inquire about the current scenario in the college by getting in touch with students who are studying there currently."
Mouthshut,Amity University,1,"[' Dec 08, 2015 ']","Dear Sir,I had applied online for my son for the Bachelor of Interior Design Course in Amity University, Mumbai on 13th April 2015 and paid the necessary application fees. The entrance test was to be held at the end of April, but till end of June this was not held. I kept following up with their admission in-charge Mr Vishal Acharya for the date of the test. Each time his response was they are waiting for approval from the Council of Architecture for conducting this degree course. I have got all the email correspondences in this regard.There was  no concrete response as to the date of test and whether Amity got the approval for the course. Moreover, admissions at other institutes/colleges were closing and I wrote an email on 30th May that I wished to cancel the application and to refund my application fees. After sending emails and making numerous phone calls, Mr Vishal / Mr Kalpak replied that my request was forwarded to their ‘Concern Authorities’ and they will process the refund by end of September 2015.Till today I have not received my fees back, though I have been calling Amity for a quick redressal of my issue. Without necessary approvals in place, how does an institute like Amity advertise/call for applications and put the future of students at stake. Even after 4 months they have not refunded the application fees. Last month, after continuous follow up they asked for address/bank details and confirmed that they would mail a cheque which has yet to come. The phone numbers of their officer and offices are switched off(9930841748 / 02143205037 / 02143205038).

Mouthshut,Amity University,5,"[' May 08, 2015 ']","Two years back I applied for several engineering entrance exam and cracked many like NIT durgapur, NIT rourkela, NIT raipur and private institutions like VIT, KIIT, SRM, Symbiosis and of course Amity noida. I wanted to study either CSE, EEE or ECE for my higher education.After doing some research on these universities and their placements and faculty I found out that AMITY would be a great choice.The examination system was also one of its kind.I wondered why none of my teachers nor friends suggested me that college.In their website at a first glance anyone will think that its a one of a kind university which takes into account the actual credentials and will harvest a students brain and make him a strong competitor for the harsh outside world.Many will also think its like the universities which they have abroad.I was no different and had thought the same.I forced my parents to admit me there.We were from a middle class family.(My mom is a civil engineer and my dad is a lawyer.)Not listening to my elder's and denying to go to NIT's or SRM and VIT was the biggest mistake of my life.AMITY IS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON PAPER.I REPEAT ITS NOT.The campus is pretty high techy, I admit that though its smaller than many.The labs are not updated to the current period.The faculty is just a show.My high school computer teacher knew more than my teacher at AMITY.(my high school year's were spent in Don Bosco Liluah and I had got 92% in my ISC).Anyway back to ""non profit organisation"" aka AMITY.There is no pressure in amity, the teachers are very causal and get annoyed when asked questions based on the curriculum.They just attend the class, take out a big fat foreign published book and just read out from that or just copy paste the stuff on the boards.There is very less scope of original work and even less scope for collaborating with other streams and make new things.The quality of students is not that good. Ok enough of faculty criticizing.If some of you are interested in sports then I'm sorry to say its not a good place for you either.There's only one big green field where every sport is played.Cramped and not up to the mark.For the man eaters out there the food is quite good.Though there's a lot of cons about this university there's some pros too.It does develop you're communication skills and over all grasp on the english language.It also prepares you for GRE and TOEFL.People who are now thinking that this is quite important are right but one should also understand that this wont fetch you a job in a reputed company as a researcher.Even if you get a job in microsoft(which you probably wont from amity) you will get the post related to marketing.As I was a EEE at amity and I can tell you the grasp over the subject is very poor for most of the students.People say that when you're in college what you do matter's the most, not the environment.This is not true, if your'e willing to pay more than 12 lacs you should go to a university which you like as a whole.Environment is important for keeping a cool mind and working on you're ideas.Good quality classmates also helps you to accelerate toward your dream and ambitions.You guys are probably wondering whether i'm still studying in amity.The answer is no.I again appeared for my JEE mains and also advanced and now I'm studying at IIIT hyderabad and I must say I'm a happy students here.(MBA and LAW aspirants go for amity without hesitating for a second, engineering students, think twice or more)."

Thanks to the loads of money spent on advertisement and TV commercials. But then, with time, I found out that the students of this institution are way behind what they claim. Their domain knowledge is very mediocre and often have a poor General Knowledge which forms the very basic of any career.

Don't go by their advertisements, they are absolutely fake. This place is nothing less than a horror show.

I am a Pass-out of Amity and I somehow managed to quiet a few stuff. Amity has the worst engineering school in INDIA, I mean it when I say it,The faculty is below average as in the most of the Indian Engineering schools. The Reason I mention worst is when all the factors combined. No study Environment, No proper classes, Unnecessary exams, No encouragement for Innovation, Namesake Incubators.The bureaucracy system is worst than Indian government. Amity wastes loads of papers every day. please take that Green courses out of your school, when you don't follow it, you have no right to promote it. All the institution cares about is how to push you into a company that comes to take students in, well the students spend more than 4lakhs per year altogether(hostellers) and they earn an average of 3lakhs per annum. it has a bad reputation among the corporates.The course is framed from IIT's and NIT's, The faculty has no F*G idea tough. they prepare you for exams, not knowledge not at all knowledge. Amity doesn't have a technical fest, where does all the money students pay go? that too in a non profit organisation. No Clubs are funded, none groups are motivated, where will the students who spend so much money only on education get money to do projects. ""Research oriented"", MY FOOT. Arrogant non teaching staff. worst annual festival. Everybody in the organising committee care is how much money can they scam into their pockets, Well right from the vice chancellors chair, everybody in the committee hides money from sponsors and hardly spend about 25%.

Infrastructure is bogus. The Chancellor- Self proclaimed Philanthropist. He works hard to promote the university and money to bag, but he has to maintain the quality, sorry Amity never had the quality.

Mouthshut,Amity University,1,"[' Aug 04, 2014 ']","A private University like Amity should not be allowed to create and amass wealth. Some of the specific flaws and ill deeds are listed below - 1.    Students –a)  Sponsored and non-sponsored category in admission without any logic. Two categories of fees namely sponsored and non-sponsored with huge variations in amount between them is a total fraud.b)  Admissions take place right from April till October and in some cases even beyond. These continue even when seats are full. Every person pays Rs. 1100/-. Thus money made in crores. No regard to academic norms.c)  There is no reservation of seat for physically disabled. There is no incentive for sportsmen. No special quota for them.d)  There is no scope of admission to SC, ST, EWS or OBC.e)  Hundreds of students are struck of for non-payment of fees. They are expected to do so even before completion of one semester. If one is not able to pay fees before start of semester then each one of them has to pay rupees 15, 000/- for re-admission. This is cheating and fraud.f)  Hundreds of students are failed and then given re-exam by way of supplementary exams. This is a trick only to generate extra money.g)  The policy of having special supplementary exam for final year and pre-final year students and of improvement examination is a fraud and clever way to favor highly connected students.h)  Large amount is collected from students for late fee deposit charges, issue of duplicate I card or mark sheet or admit cards. Total income in lakhs is earned by the Amity in this way.i)  Students are not paid traveling allowance, boarding, lodging and registration fee most of the time when they go out to represent Amity.j)  Laboratories are without necessary equipment. Chemicals and maintenance stores are not provided.k)  Strict and unreasonable rules for attendance. No consideration is given for sickness or other misfortunes.l)  A Moot Court hall is provided but is generally misused for other purposes.m)  A student wanting to discontinue studies and shift to some other University/college is denied migration certificate or NOC till he pays for the entire programme. This is unreasonable and illegal. This is so even if one wants to go to ALS Delhi from ALS Noida. 2.     Family and Staff –a)  Nonpayment of remuneration to faculty for invigilation, moderation and paper setting. Academic work is substandard. Amity,(AUUP) is one university where teaching, paper setting, invigilation, moderation and evaluation are done by same faculty. Even syllabus is decided by the same set of people.b)  Non-payment to faculty of full scale of UGC grade. Latest UGC scales are not being paid. Though in NCR, HRA and other allowances even when given are of UP rates.c)  Faculty is kept busy in various administrative works(like Mentor, CR, Sangathan, Human Values Quarter, Anti ragging or Youth Fest etc) but no payment is given to them.d)  No salary slip is issued to faculty and staff. No one knows the reason for deduction.e)  Very complex rules for promotion and assessment, increment criteria.f)  No promotion boards held in last two years. All are disgusted. A number of faculties who had appeared for promotion board over eighteen months back are unaware of results. No promotion to the staff and inadequate increment given.g)  Annual increments are delayed over two years. Even when finally given, the amount is small. Management thus saves lakhs of rupees by way of interest.h)  Payment of visiting faculty is very meager.i)  Having very large number of post in AUUP that have no academic relevance.j)  Lack of Standards – a large number of faculty do not meet the criteria of minimum qualifications laid down. A number of faculties are without NET and/or Ph.D.k)  Hundreds of Faculties have resigned in last five years due to frustration.l)  Faculty is not given benefits of PF, gratuity, leave encashment or medical etc.m)  DA is kept pending.n)  No allowances or honorarium paid to do library or mentor work or stream coordinators.o)  Faculty is kept busy in various administrative works but no payment is given to them.p)  Faculties are not allowed to form union to look into and project their demands.q)  No benefit of leave or vacations to part time faculty.r)  No motivation for staff.s)  One of the Directors of a teaching institution cannot speak English. The person does not teach. It is a mystery how Ph.D being done under Dr.'-'. It is being written by Ms.'-' and typed by Ms'-'.t)  No facility of car loan, conveyance loan or house loan to faculty and staff.u)  Study leave provision for the faculty is non-existent.v)  All faculty and staff have to subscribe to bio metric attendance at the main gate and also in the building. Beyond this they have to record entry and departure manually in the attendance register.Peons and Class IV – almost all of them are on contract and denied to minimum wages. Staff and class 4 employees including casual labor are totally exploited.Library –i-  Law Library is ill equipped. Number of books is very small. Books over Rs. 1000/ are not encouraged for procurement.ii- No safety or security in library. Thefts are rampant.VISIT OF UGC EXPERT COMMITTEEThey are fooled during their inspections. There are no faculty boards, offices or meetings etc.Chairman of BCI, Bar Council of UP and Delhi are entertained. But Bar Council norms are flouted.The land and assets are in name of the foundation.Huge gaps in the number of Associate Professors and Professors. The faculty is disillusioner and lacks motivation.Accreditation is achieved by dubious means. NAAC ranking was managed by deceit and bribes.

Raste, Dr. Mrs. S.K. Verma, Maj Gen R K Dhawan, Sanjeev Chaturvedi left? They were all disgusted.Statutory Bodies –EC, AC and BOS are held as mere rituals. Agenda is circulated just one day in advance or even or same day. Minutes are issued months later.Multipulation – the management boasts of close ties and favour done to many eminent personalities. They have all been obliged and influenced.Secular outlook and practice are suppressed. Arya Samaj practices are compulsory.Members of the inspection, audit and quality teams from outside in the past have all been influenced by lavish gifts and undesirable approaches.Undue interference by the chancellor in even routine matters whereas role of the Visitor is only cosmetic.Size of classes(number of students in some institutions) is too large. Check up the attendance register.Different policy for UP(Lucknow) and Noida campuses.A practice of having private events like Sangathan or Amity Human Values Quarter and Day of Belonging to celebrate birthdays.Honorary doctorates are awarded during the convocation or at special convocation only to cultivate person in high authority.Retention of very old faculty like Dr. Ajeet Verma, Dr. Surendra Kumar, A.K.

Durgan, B B Dhar, B B Singh, HSP Singh, BP Singh Sehgal, PD Bhargava, RM Agarwal, KS Bains, Tahir Mehmood, JK Mittal, Nilendra Kumar and V N Wadhva, R C Kochhar more than forty others due to this yunger faculty is deep motivated.Defective cadre structure where there are very few Prof and Associate Prof.The bathrooms are poorly equipped with no soap, towels or tissue papers.ACs are not functional.Corruption is all pervasive amongst security staff at the gates.Amity taken pride in acquiring recognitions and accreditations from dubious and unknown ranking agencies.There is cheating by having similar institutions like ASB, ABS and AIBS etc.All contracts for canteen, shops, photocopy, buses and security have been managed by the family member of the trustees.How is it that in very short time amity has set-up university campuses at Noida, Lucknow, Chhattisgarh, Jaipur(Rajasthan) Manesar(Haryana), Gwalior(Madhya Pradesh), New Bombay(Maharashtra) North-east, Dubai, Singapur and other places."

I had called up for a query regarding my brother's admission. He was granted admission in IB initially and then of course he tried opting for other specializations. He did this twice and now he wanted to switch back to IB. The reason behind this was that he didn't get a proper unbiased counseling.And now when I came into the conversation loop, the counselor spoke in a very rude and frustrating way. I myself am a filmmaker and its part of my profession to read the insight of human beings. I found this so funny and so sad at the same time. A prestigious institution which is to give education to the youth of India has such uneducated and illiterate(I am judging the behavior and not the person's CV) people in their counsel section. She didn't even tell me her name or else I would have found time to come there personally and would have shared her agonies and frustration because of which she gets in this mode of talking to the students and parents.This is such a shameful state for AMITY.

Most importantly it feels like you have entered a jail, for they don't treat you like adults, but school kids, sleeveless is not allowed, nor are capris, plus attendance is a must on certain days like fest and Ashok Chauhan's birthday.So any free will or right to choice is trampled in amity and the faculty is so bad and snobbish that even if you ask for clarification, they get irritated after a point and are unable to clarify your doubts anyhow. so please take a year off and prepare for another university, but don't go to amity! its not worth your money at all!"

Mouthshut,Amity University,1,"[' May 16, 2011 ']","Twenty-two sprawling campuses. 35, 000  students. 130 professional degree courses. That’s the Amity universe.  But what these promos fail to mention is that Amity directors Ashok  Kumar Chauhan and Arun  KumarChauhan also face  an international arrest warrant. Interpol has issued a Red Corner  Notice against them for alleged frauds committed in Federal Republic of  Germany. The German Embassy has requested the Indian government for  extradition, but the Chauhans have successfully evaded  arrest/extradition for close to a decade. Ashok first went to Germany as  a student, from western UP, and stayed on to trade in chemicals.Ashok  and Arun duped banking institutions not only in Germany,  but elsewhere too.The Delhi High Court, on a petition filed by US-based  Formossa Plastics Corporation, had restrained them from disposing of or  otherwise encumbering properties standing/acquired in the names of the  Ritnanad Balved Education Foundation (Ashok is the founder president of  the foundation which runs Amity institutions), Ritnanad Balved Medical  Foundation, Europa Foundation and his Trust Foundation.Formossa  requested the judiciary for registration of an fir against Ashok and  others for cheating them. The Chauhans purchased plastic material from  the company, but did not bother to clear the bills. Their total  liability: Rs 95 crore. Based on the US company’s petition, the other  properties on which the restraint order was issued were: 15 acres in  Sector 44, Noida (Amity School complex); B-166, Sector 36; 113 acres at  Panchgaon Manesar; and 5 acres in Saket.On another petition filed by  kreiss Bank, Germany, the Delhi High Court attached bank accounts worth  Rs 15 crore of Ashok and his family. A Netherlands-based company, kivo,  also filed a suit against the Chauhans for recovery of approximately Rs  10 crore, the bill for purchase of materials from the company. Ashok and  Arun, now residing at E-27, Defence Colony, New Delhi, are accused of  intending to get hold of unlawful property and of having caused property  damages to others by concealing facts.According to the arrest warrant  issued against them by the German judicial authorities, the brothers  fooled credit institutions and banks. They claimed that their firms,  kunstoplast and kunstochem, in Germany, were solvent enterprises and  between November 1993 and March 1994, Ashok obtained discounted loans on  bills of exchange from various financial institutions. They pretended  that the credit slips were good bills of exchange. But the bills of  exchange were not paid on due date because the drawees were insolvent.  The warrant states that the accused were able to withdraw in time —  after spending nearly two decades in the country — to escape German  prosecution. They camouflaged their flights abroad as business trips,  and never returned. Ashok left Germany after March 26, 1994 on the  pretext of negotiating with sponsors to save his akc group in Germany.  On reaching Delhi, he filed a petition for bankruptcy (from June to  November 1994). Alexander Frey, head, legal department, Kreiss Bank  Frankfurt, told Tehelka, “Ashok and Arun have damaged kreiss Bank by $6  million (Rs 24 crore approx) and some more banks have lost between  $15-20 million (Rs 60-80 crore approx).” Public Prosecutor Dominique  Crede also confirmed this in an e-mail. Frey in an e-mail said the  district attorney in Frankfurt had been trying to get the Chauhans  extradited to Germany since 1996.The German Embassy spokesman in New  Delhi, Michael Reiffuenstuel, said, “The arrest warrants against Ashok  and Arun are open and valid. There is a Red Corner Notice against them  for frauds committed in Germany. In 2003, the embassy wrote to the  ministry of external affairs. Oral requests were also made for their  extradition, but there has been no response.”Further, Minister of State  for External Affairs E. Ahmed, in a written reply dated May 12, to an  unstarred question asked by Rajya Sabha mp RK Anand, confirmed: “…valid  warrants of arrest issued by German judicial authorities against Shri  Ashok Kumar Chauhan and Arun Kumar Chauhan, directors of Amity  International, Ghaziabad, UP, exist and the Interpol has issued Red  Corner Notices Nos. 453/1990 and 459/1998 at the request of Interpol  Wiesbaden… The Embassy of Federal Republic of Germany in India has  requested for legal assistance in serving documents/extradition of Ashok  Kumar Chauhan and Arun Kumar Chauhan.”The arrest warrant, an English  translation of which was procured by Tehelka, lists six cases against  the Chauhans. In the first case, the accused submitted to the kreiss  Bank one bill of exchange of over dm 496, 628.00 for discounting and for  crediting the discount proceeds to kunstoplast’s account with the bank.  The total damage to the bank was dm 487, 832.58 (Rs 5, 90, 28, 398). This  bill was issued on November 18, 1993, and was due on March 5, 1994. The  firm, kivo, in Volendam, was the issuer and kunstoplast was the drawee.  The acceptance of the drawee as well as the endorsement for kreiss Bank  were signed by Ashok. The bill was protested on March 8, 1994, due to  lack of payment.Another case was to the disadvantage of Savings Bank  Naila, wherein by mutual agreement with the conspirators, the accused,  Arun, requested that the bank discount a bill of exchange of over dm  448, 200.00 and credit the discount proceeds to the account of  kunstochem. The bill was protested on March 11, 1994 for lack of  payment. The total damage to the bank dm 438, 980.53 (Rs 5, 31, 16, 580).In  the third case, kreiss Bank was commissioned by the accused to discount a  bill of over dm 532, 125.00 on behalf of the firm, kunstoplast. This  bill was issued on November 22, 1993 and was due on March 16, 1994. Due  to lack of payment the bank protested the bill on March 18, 1994. The  total damage was dm 523, 477.97 (Rs 6, 33, 40, 717). The fourth case relates  to disadvantage of Savings Bank Naila and the damage was dm 533, 042.81.  The acceptance of the drawee as well as the mentioned endorsements were  signed by Ashok. The bill was protested due to lack of payment. The  warrant states that the accused, Arun, disposed of the credit balance to  transfer dm 544, 000.00. The total damage was dm 533, 042.81 (Rs  6, 44, 98, 082).The fifth case was to the disadvantage of kreiss Bank and  the damage was dm 568.619, 40. The bank protested this bill on March 28,  1994, due to lack of payment. On December 27, 1993, the discount  proceeds of dm 568, 619.40 were deposited in the account and were used to  credit the overdraft limit of dm 1 million, which was again by  disposals in January and February 1994, fully exhausted. The total  damage was dm 568, 619.40 (Rs 6, 88, 02, 899). The last case also pertained  to disadvantages to kreiss Bank and the damage was dm 543, 881.00. On  March 10, 1994, the accused submitted to kreiss Bank a bill of exchange  of over dm 556, 400.00 with the request for discount to credit the  proceeds to kunstoplast. The total damage was dm 543, 881.00 (Rs  6, 58, 09, 601).There are signatures of Ashok on the acceptance as well as  endorsement of the drawee to the kreiss Bank. Due to lack of payment the  bill was protested on June 13, 1994."

I will talking about this university from a parent and a student perspective. First of all as a parent it is very hard to even think about getting your kid admitted in this university mainly because of the course fees are so high that a common middle class man of India can't afford it. I mean they have just opened a shop on the name of education where only rich can get educated. I don't understand one thing why a university should look like a five star hotel with all the big fast food chains in the campus. I believe that the campus of the university should showcase that how their peace and calm environment is helping students to focus. I think if nothing changes then in few years they will even have a mall and a cinema hall in the campus. I want to ask how a kid will study with so much to distract and that too without parents guidance. These institutes are only for rich who only came to college for getting any XYZ degree so that they can run their family business after some enjoyment in life. Girls in these institutes looks like they are on some fashion parade every day. I mean the focus should be on studies not on other things.Hence not recommended.ThanksSid

Let me tell you that half the negative reviews here are written by frustrated souls who couldn’t make a mark in college(no offence to them). Also that most of the facts are cooked up and fake.To start with, the story of how I ended up at Amity University Rajasthan is one for another day. But I must tell you that my grades and profile have always been way above decent, and I might have gone to a top notch institute had some unforeseen circumstances not entered my way. But not one bit do I regret studying at Amity University. Since I have only seen Amity University Noida and Rajasthan, I would be commenting solely on their pros and cons.AMITY in general: Amity University has some super cool features, that I truly appreciate -Academic Curriculum: The curriculum is one of the best in the country. With it being inclusive of a mandatory choice of Foreign Language(you get to choose one among French, Spanish, Chinese and German), Basket Course(it is an interdisciplinary program that lets you choose subjects like Cooking, Stitching, Law, Governance, Business, Ethics etc.), Behavioral Science(in other words, Psychology. Why become a graduate if you cannot understand the way your mind functions?), Communication Skills(English, Soft Skills Training, Prose, Poetry, Interview and Group Discussion Tips - everything is covered) etc.Courses and Specializations: There are umpteen options available, but I’d like to draw your attention to two programs I really love -(a) Study Abroad Program. This is a student exchange program, that lets you study in the international campuses of Amity University for three semesters(one in every year, excluding the final year).(b) Six Sigma Program. You could google what it encompasses. The best part is, it costs Amitians less than five or six thousand rupees. Normally, they charge you triple or quadruple this price!Alma Mater: The alumni! Most students from Amity tend to split into unconventional careers. The ones who end up in big corporates are in large numbers too. So, you will never face a shortage of people willing to help you out, when in need. I know so many seniors who got into good jobs and positions only because their seniors recommended them.WiFi: Most people I know study in colleges where mobile phones are not allowed. It is sad. Amity University has decent WiFi speed as well. There are also LAN connections in all academic blocks."

Trust me, it may not be an indicator of a successful person but still it matters in a cut-throat competitive environment.2) Be proactive. Participate in debates. Join a club, placement committee.etc. On  campus or off-campus.3) A few Teachers are a bit biased towards students who keep dogging them around and  end up getting more marks in the internals. Keep a lookout for them. And don't screw your internals thinking i'll make it up in the externals out of 70 marks. Also maintain your attendance at 75%. It would be a utter waste not to give the paper because you got debarred.4) Tips for students studying Biotechnology(as I was a student of the same)  -Don't think that the course becomes easy once you enter the 2nd year with Bio based subjects. It is equally hard across the semesters.5) THE MOST IMP TIP - REGARDING PLACEMENTS - Please note that the college does not guarantee 100% placements. It may sound fanciful in a brochure you picked up on your way to the campus but the real scenario is quite different. A few companies will come to campus and it is absolutely imperative that you sit for these companies and grab your offer letter ASAP. Do not worry about the salary or work they would offer you. Most of the time it  will be below your expectations. But nonetheless, you must try your luck."

Most colleges do not focus much on practical knowledge but again this is in no way stopping you from going ahead and practicing on your own( no spoon feeding) . Learn a new language of your interest once you grasp the basics. After this lets come to the internship part, they are decent enough. I did my internship in AT& T which is a pretty good organization to go ahead and work for even for a short duration. Most students get internships on their own so you can go for Amazon however it does not come for internship recruitment. Placements are good in comparison to a lot of private and other colleges. In my batch the maximum package went for 8.5 LPA but again if you perform well in your internship that same company might offer you a package much more( 13LPA+ in a friends case) , so it all comes down to what you did different in those 4 years of your college which later makes it much simple to get into a company you want while others are struggling with testing and support jobs.

Mouthshut,Amity University,1,"[' Sep 12, 2016 ']","If you intend to waste ur parents money then I would suggest you to burn it all rather than joining Amity, at least the fire would keep you warm for some time - that is much more useful than Amity will ever be to youFirst and foremost please dont consider Amity as an institution that aims to provide you with education, that is the last thing Amity is. Amity is a business with its main agenda being  misguiding the students that are in a point in life where they feel lost.BOTTOM LINE - there are mainly 2 reasons why someone decides to join a college - Education or college life, amity wont provide you with either.>Education - as bad as it can get, horrible faculty, in no way whatsoever even worth 10% of the total fees, if you intend to study to make urself capable then my friend dont even read rest of the review just forget that Amity even exists>College life - once you join amity you wont even have ur own normal life leave alone college life, classes get over at 5 in the evening, 75% attendance and NO MEDICAL ACCEPTED(no matter how genuine) so bunking is a luxury, quality of students debatable since literally no whatsoever admission criteriaI would only suggest this college if you fulfill all the following criteria-1)ur motive is to pass time for few years since ur bored sitting at home,2)you dont need a degree or education since you already have to join family business,3)most importantly if you have around 10lakh rs to wasteA little in depth to why Amity is probably the worst decision you will make in ur life:->Completely unreasonable fees - The quality of education they provide is a joke when you take into account the price tag on each of the courses. For 10% of Amity's fees you can get a much more reputable degree, 10 times better education.The only thing that you will get from that huge fees is their infrastructure, I am not sure what one is supposed to do with that but to each their own->Faculty is a joke - I cannot say this about all courses but everyday in classes I used to think that this must be some kind of elaborate joke, anytime now someone will kick open the door of the class and tell us that infact they are the real teacher and the guy is pretending to be our teacher and this was just a practical joke, and I kept waiting but that day never came.I will give the teachers the benefit of doubt and say that they might have the knowledge but majority of them are truly miserable when it comes to their teaching skills. Out of 15 faculty members I had the opportunity of learning from literally only 1 could be considered as a real teacher, with that probability I wouldnt be so sure about the faculty of other courses as well->Student welfare will never ever be in their priority list - The day you submit your fees is the last day they would care about you, you officially are all on ur own now.No medical certificates allowed - God forbid you face an emergency and that causes you to miss out on ur education, Amity will provide you no assistance at all no matter if u are hospitalized or ur loved ones are on their deathbeds.You will be marked absent, they will refuse help. I must provide 1 example from my experience. I was severely ill and was hospitalized for a little less than a month, I went to the dy director of their Institute and explained to him what I was going through, showed him not only my medical certificates but literally also the medical bills for the month.His reply to me after listening to the troubles I went through was ""we are not legally liable to anything, if you want to continue with us then u should submit fees for the next semester"". ->75% attendance or fail - Generally almost all colleges have attendance rules and there is nothing wrong about it since they implement such rule to make sure students attend classes. The rule is same here but the motive of having such rule isnt. It is just a convenient way for them to ask you for more money and more importantly so that after you face so much delay(can only give re-examinations after 1 sem, i.e. if you fail to keep 75% attendance in 2nd sem you can only appear for exams in 4th sem) and troubles completing ur course that you will have to come back to amity for further studies too->Admission Tests are a formality - I feel the entrance tests can tell you a lot about the standard of the institute - what they stand for and what they wish to be in the future. This just further proves the fact that they are indeed a business. Like any other business they wish to maximize their profits which in this case would be to accept everything and anything.Personally to me the crowd of a college isnt an issue, it is the last thing that concerns me about accepting everyone. But when an institute has no admission criteria whatsoever that just showcases their true colors. In this case being duping & fooling as many naive students as quickly as possible.|-| HUMBLE REQUEST TO PEOPLE PRAISING AMITY, TALK TO ME IN THE COMMENTS BELOW HOW IS IT ANY GOOD BECAUSE WHEN YOU LIE ABOUT AN INSTITUTE LIKE THIS YOU ARE LITERALLY WASTING HUMAN LIVES - MONEY, TIME, EFFORT OF INDIVIDUAL AND HIS FAMILY JUST BEING DESTROYED. AT LEAST KEEP THAT IN MIND BEFORE SPREADING MISINFORMATION|-|"

Every college has a bad side, and a good side. Amity may not be the college to look for intellectual growth but for courses like journalism, fashion designing etc this place is right for you.

Mouthshut,Amity University,4,"[' Feb 29, 2016 ']","Location:It is located in sector 125 of Noida, right on the highway that goes to Greater Noida. The college is well connected with Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad by road. Private buses regularly ply here from various parts of NCR. One can also travel by the Delhi Metro as the nearest metro station, which is Botanical Garden on the blue line, is merely 4 km away and cabs are available between metro and the college for Rs 30. However most students do not like to travel every day to college, instead they stay in the college hostels.Infrastructure:Well the infrastructure is something out of this world which keeps you awe-struck for long time once you see it. The campus is like a small fortress protected with Z-level security. You can enter or exit only by swiping your RFID cards. There are various blocks for academic buildings and hostels. In each block there’s a central open area where there’s either a garden or playground or STEAMPOTRESTAURANTs and lot of place to sit. The central area of the main block (i.e H-block) is a really happening place with franchisees of famous cafes & STEAMPOTRESTAURANTs like CCD, Dominos, Subway and Dosa Plaza. There’s also a book shop where you can buy all the academic as well as non-academic books and there’s a nice stationary shop called P3 in H block. All the buildings are centrally air-conditioned and all the facilities that may ever be needed in a college are there. There is a separate library for each department and each library has ample number of books. There’s also something called as e-library and it can be accessed through the college intranet. There’s Wi-Fi connectivity all over the campus, but when everyone is simultaneously online, the net speed is terribly reduced due to bandwidth sharing.The college provides excellent hostel facilities and makes sure that all those who need accommodation gets one either at one of the six campus hostels or if they get full then at off-campus hostels in sector 44. The hostels are like residential apartments and the rooms are very well furnished. The rooms are available as single or 2/3/4 sharing and you’ve to pay accordingly. First years aren’t given single rooms no matter what. AC rooms are also available, which are said to be much better than non-ac, are also priced very high, of course. They’re all clean and spacious with attached washrooms. There are some facilities which will make your friends at other colleges envy such as room service and free tea/coffee from the vending machines at all times.In short infra can be rated as 10/10 and it is the USP of Amity.Courses offered:Amity offers hundreds of courses. You name it they have it, and in case they don’t, they might as well start a new course just for you...not really! Here’s a small list of some of the courses offered here. Please refer their website amity.edu for the entire list of courses along with their specializations.BA, MAB.Arch, M.ArchB.Pharm, M.PharmB.Com, M.ComB.Tech, M.TechB.Sc, M.ScBCA, MCABBA, MBA, PGDMBJMCLLB, LLMFees:Studying at Amity is going to cost you (read your parents) a bomb. The fees vary as per the course, but trust us none of it is cheap. Again you can refer their website to know the fees of the course you’re looking for. And it has been heard that they increase the fees by 5% every semester.Faculty:There’s a mixture of average and good faculties at Amity. Some are very senior professors who’ve tremendous experience in teaching and research. The teachers for professional courses are among the better ones while those for Arts, science and commerce don’t seem to be that good, especially when compared with DU colleges. But above all they’re all very friendly with the students and are always eager to help them out with their doubts.Attendance:Extremely strict. You have to attend 75% of the lectures, in case you don’t you are in for a big trouble. They will start with deducting your internal marks and can even fail you if you don’t improve. Also a monthly report of each student’s attendance is updated on college intranet which can be accessed by parents. So you better be attending the lectures in this college.Crowd:The crowd belongs to the elite class, obviously as they only would be able to bear the fees of this college. There are a few spoilt brats trying to bully others but in general the crowd is decent and friendly. People come from all parts of NCR. Crowd is lively and cheerful which makes the campus life happening. There are a few people who like to travel to the college, study and go home but if you really want to enjoy the college life you should stay at the college hostels. Although they’re strict about timings at the hostels during weekdays you can roam out till late or all night during weekends, there’s no restriction over it.Hangouts:Atta market in sector 18 where there are a lot of malls and shops is the favourite hangout for the students. The Great India Place (GIP) mall in sector 18 is their favourite mall. Apart from this there are a lot of small ‘Dhabas’ and shacks serving cheap and delicious food near the college on the highway. Students like these shacks especially as they get non-veg which is not served in college canteens. When you have such a great campus that also is counted as a hangout and students are seen roaming around in the campus with their friends.Canteen:Each department has a canteen of their own, plus there’s a common food-court in H block. Also there are mess of each hostel. The food served here is tasty and it is moderately priced. You get a LOT of variety in food items and also in taste of the same food item at different canteens.Festivals:There are a lot of festivals, at least one of each department. 'Sangathan' is the annual inter Amity sports festival arranged on the foundation day of the college in the month of September. Students from all the Amity campuses in India and abroad take part in this event. Each student has to participate in this festival; not doing so can affect your marks.Placements:Placement scenario is different for different courses. Engineering and Management have better placements than others. Statistically speaking 100% students from these courses gets placed with average salary of Rs 3 Lakh. Major recruiters include Wipro, TCS, NDTV, ICICI and Reliance. Most of the engineering students get an IT job while most management students land up in a bank. If you want a job in your core field, than you can try looking off-campus.BBA, BCA, B.Com, BA, B.Sc and others don’t have that good placement. Only about 15% - 20% students get placed.Contact:Amity Delhi/Noida CampusBlock – J2, Ground FloorAmity University CampusSector-125, Noida – 201 303 (UP)Phone: 0120-2445252, 0120-4713600Email: admissions@amity.eduWebsite: amity.eduVerdict:Amity has a really good environment, a jolly crowd and one of the best infrastructures in the country.

A good choice for those who want to enjoy their college life (of course all this comes for a high cost). "
